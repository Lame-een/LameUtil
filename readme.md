# Lame's Utilities

Utility headers containing classes/structs/functions.

Currently implemented are:
* EasyRandom - contains all the things you need for quickly generating random numbers.
* vec/SimpleVec - structs containing rudimentary implementations of 2/3/4 component vectors.
* LoadBar - a class that can be used together with C++ for loops in order to print a loading bar to the standard output.
* BenchTime - simple RAII benchmarking class.

Instructions for each class are at the beginning of the headers.
